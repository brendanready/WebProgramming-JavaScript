// Part 3 - Date and Date Functions

/* 
1.  Create an application that gets the number of days in a month. 
    Display that result within the console window.
2.  Create an application that gets the month name from a particular date. 
    Display that result within the console window.
3.  Create an application that tests whether a date is a weekend. 
    Display that result within the console window.
4.  Create an application that gets yesterdayâ€™s day of the week. 
    For instance, if today is Tuesday, the console window should display Monday.
5.  Create an application that gets the current day of the week. 
    The twist here is that I want only the first letter of the day. 
    If today is Tuesday, the letter T should be displayed in the console window.
